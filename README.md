# RStudio in Binder using a Dockerfile

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/gergness/dockerfile-rstudio/master)

Forked, because I'm trying to get R 3.2 support

This is a proof-of-concept to deploy a Binder that exposes the
RStudio UI instead of a Jupyter Notebook. It also installs
several packages from the tidyverse, and includes a demo
script to show off functionality.

To start your RStudio session, click on "new", and at the bottom will
be `RStudio Session`. Click that and you're ready to go!

*Special thanks to Ryan Lovett (@ryanlovett) for figuring out
RStudio support with JupyterHub*
